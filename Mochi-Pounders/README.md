# Code Folder README

This folder contains the source code for the game Mochi Pounders.

All files are eponymously named according to their function in the game. The one exception is `mainwindow.h`, `mainwindow.cpp`, and `mainwindow.ui`; these files implement the main game window.

All `.png` files are custom images created for the game; see the `/Images` directory in the repo for more.
